#**Metal Defect Detection using CNN**

This project addresses the problem of automatically detecting defects in casting products in industrial manufacturing using a deep learning approach.

It is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify whether a given metal surface contains defects or not. The CNN model uses multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the input images. The final dense layers help binary classify the images based on the extracted features. 

I have taken the dataset from kaggle, the dataset contains
